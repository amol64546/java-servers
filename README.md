# 🧠 REST Server Options for a Single Endpoint – Lightweight Comparison

## 🥇 Lightest Option: `HttpServer` (Java SE Built-In)

**TL;DR:**  
Fast, feather-light, minimal memory footprint. Works best if you're allergic to dependencies.

- **Footprint:** ~5–10 MB memory, no external jars required.
- **Startup Time:** Sub-second.
- **Deployment:** Run directly with a `main()` method — no server container needed.
- **Good For:**
    - Prototyping
    - Tiny container images
    - CLI tools
    - Constrained environments (IoT, embedded)

**Gotchas:**
- No JAX-RS annotations.
- Manual routing logic (`if`/`switch` on URI paths).
- Not as extensible or feature-rich (e.g., no filters/interceptors/middleware).

**✅ Verdict:**  
Best for ultra-minimal use cases where you don’t care about REST conventions or fancy DI magic.

## 🥈 JAX-RS (e.g., Jersey) + Tomcat

**TL;DR:**  
Still light-ish if you DIY your setup, but adds more moving parts.

- **Footprint:** ~50–70 MB depending on libraries.
- **Startup Time:** A few seconds; Tomcat adds some weight.
- **Deployment:** WAR or embedded Tomcat + Jersey setup.
- **Good For:**
    - REST-compliant services
    - Standardized annotations (`@GET`, `@Path`, `@Produces`)

**Gotchas:**
- More verbose setup.
- Need to wire Tomcat/Jersey manually or use heavier frameworks to do it for you.
- You’ll be chasing ClassLoaders and `web.xml` config if you're not careful.

**✅ Verdict:**  
OK compromise, but you might be bringing a gun to a water balloon fight for just one endpoint.

## 🥉 Spring Boot

**TL;DR:**  
Extremely popular, but not “lightweight” unless you're using Spring Boot 3’s native image support.

- **Footprint:** ~100–150 MB memory.
- **Startup Time:**
    - 2–6 seconds (Java)
    - ~100 ms (GraalVM native image)
- **Deployment:** Fat JAR or native image.
- **Good For:**
    - Production-grade services
    - Metrics, health checks, security
    - Opinionated defaults

**Gotchas:**
- Heavy if you’re literally just exposing `@GetMapping("/ping")`.
- Higher build complexity if you want native image benefits.

**✅ Verdict:**  
Probably overkill for “just one endpoint,” unless you’re already deep in Springland.
